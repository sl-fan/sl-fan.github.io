## About Me （范松林）

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow jointly affiliated with China Mobile (Shanghai) Industrial Research Institute and Fudan University, as a member of [FVL](https://fvl.fudan.edu.cn/main.htm). My research lies at the intersection of multimodal learning and computer vision, with a particular emphasis on 3D data processing and analysis. I received my Ph.D. in 2024 from the School of Computer Science, Peking University, as a member of [NERCVT](https://idm.pku.edu.cn/), and spent five years as a research intern at Peng Cheng Laboratory.

😊I am deeply driven by a passion for scientific innovation and a strong commitment to lifelong learning. 🤝Feel free to reach out for potential collaborations or academic discussions.
